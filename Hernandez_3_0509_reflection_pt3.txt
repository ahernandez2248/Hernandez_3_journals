Given mymap[67][43] Which is the x coordinate? Which is the y coordinate? Why? How does this happen?
~ The x coordinate is 67 and the y coordinate is 43, which happens because those were the coordinate of a graph.
    Consider:

            for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
                    if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                      if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                        } else if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.print("."); #e
                        } else {
                            System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
                        }
                    } else {
                        if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.println("."); #c
                        } else {
                            System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
            
            
          

Write the code from line #a and explain what it does.
~ if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888");
It prints 8888 if the number output equals 0

Write the code from line #b and explain what it does.
~System.out.print(map[i][j]);
It prints coordinates from the array.
 
Write the code from line #c and explain what it does. Explain how its different than #e
~System.out.println(".");
It prints a period instead of an array
 
Write the code from line #d and explain what it does.
~ System.out.println(map[i][j]);
It prints an arrraaaaay
 
Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and code example.
~Use the boolean within the while loop to create the looop. For example, creating the playable boolean and setting whle(playable) to create instance for when the game is in session.

Explain the use of static.
~You use static to state whether the method is relative or not 

Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code example.
~You can use an object to give aspects of gameplay to the player. For example you can create an object that gives health
