In your game, how can you track what challenges the player has solved?
~By tattooing "Get gud" on your forehead.

How can you track HP? Items?
~You must throw yourself in a freezing river, flail around while screaming "DETERMINATION", and wait for the sweet skeleton to take your troubles away by slam dunking you through
the timeline. Soon after, you will find the key to your unhappiness in your spaghetti. It will absorb your face and grant you your greatest desires. Sadly your greatest desire is HP.
