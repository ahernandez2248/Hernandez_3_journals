What did you miss?
~I don't know, I turned it in but it was counted missing.

What could you have done to have been more successful?
~Well there's no grade so I have a vague clue. What I do know is that I had trouble with the getters and setters. Should've studied that.

If you were successful - what was it that you did that made you successful? 
~I wouldn't know. The grade. Isn't . There.
