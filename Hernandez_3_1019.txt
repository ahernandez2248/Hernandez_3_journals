Are you? Why or why not?
~Yes, I'm creating a bubble pattern and that's exactly what it turned out to be.

This is a real question -- describe what you did the days we went over art methods. What did you write? type? What were your thoughts?
~I was trying to make sense of what was going on and what I should so I don't fail.


Did you notice that art method code was shared in the journals (as proclaimed with very large text)? Why or why not?
~Yes, it's kind of hard not to notice. 


Have you examined the sample code on github? Why or why not?
~Yes, because help was needed. Like a thnead.

Write a sample method for making a sequence of red squares on the canvas.
~  gc.setFill(Color.RED);
gc.fillRoundRect(110, 60, 30, 30, 10, 10);
