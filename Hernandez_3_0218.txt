Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);

~It sets the animation for the player's sprite.

Why would it be unrealistic / unproductive  to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
~We are trying to practice skills that helps us achieve an outcome using different methods. Memorization defeats that purpose.

What is an array?
~A way to create different objects.

How do you make an array? Give an example.
~anArray= new Array

What is an ArrayList?
~A class that implements list interface.
How do you make an arraylist?
~By using an object.
public ArrayList<Item> stuff = new ArrayList();

In Netbeans, make an arraylist. Use autocompletion with the created arraylist (the '.' and pop-up):
What are three useful arraylist methods that you identified?
~Int, boolean, string


What is the difference between an array and an arraylist?
~You can't change the size of an array but you can edit an arraylist.

How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
~By using an arraylist.
