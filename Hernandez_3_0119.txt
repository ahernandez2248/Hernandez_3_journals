What slick game did you create?
~A game where you have to collect keys and avoid a lady who wants your eyes.

What challenges did you solve
~ The challenge of getting the map to show up.

Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps and spritesheets - so that you would be ready to go with the game when we got back. Did you? Why or why not?
Yes, I worked on them during the exam since I exempted it.

Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not? [Focus on what you did or did not do. Journals ascribing blame to others will not be considered.
~No, I had so much trouble with the map I couldn't get some other things done, such as getting the enemy to work.
