What differences and similarites have you noticed? Provide at least 3 and explain in complete sentences.
~In Arduino, variables called digitalwrite and ledPins are used. Both use void methods and for loops.

What code adaptations have you made? [Or will you make if none to date. Note: 'none' is not a valid answer]
~Some code adaptiations I will make are adapting the servo fan and its rotation.

What is required for a circuit?
~A circuit needs both a negative and positve charge in order for the device to properly function.

How are programs compiled with Arduino?
~They're compiled with void methods.

Describe the projects you have completed this/last week and what you have learned from them. Descriptions should be _at least_ one full paragraph in length.
~We did projects ranging from using the leds, the servo, and the flex wire. We learned how these things function and how different parts of the arduino contribute to its functionality.

You will be completing your own project - a project of your own design that accepts user input and provides light and sound in some way.
Describe your project and the code adaptations you will have to make. [Note - 'none' is not a valid answer. For example, there is a 'Simon' game provided - using that code would earn a '0' because it is 0% your code.]
~Some code adaptions that will have to be made are combining some aspects of the user input code with the light code in order for them to function cooperatively.
