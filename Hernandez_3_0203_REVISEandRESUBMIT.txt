Why bother with revising and resubmitting?
~Well if we don't revise the world would be in absolute chaos. Nothing would work right since no one wants to fix anything. People would walk around not caring and live happily with
their lethargic and ignorant lives. We would live in filth and would have to resort to cannibalism to feed children. Science wouldn't advance so humanity would still be stuck in the
stone age where we bang rocks together in hopes of making a sandwich. WE WOULD BE DIRTY INSECTS WITH THUMBS TRYING TO FIND ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GREATEST DEPTHS OF THE PITCH BLACK VOID.
HUMANITY WOULD BE SPEAKING JIBBERISH THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS SO WE RESORT TO SLAPPING EACH OTHER JUST TO GET A POINT ACROSS. HUMANS WOULD BE NOTHING BUT ANIMALS. ALL. BECAUSE. NO. ONE.
REVISED. THEIR. THINGS.
...
Which is why we revise and resubmit our games so we won't revert back to cavemen and advance society.
