The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals --- other students had no recollection. 
Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)
Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - that you predict will be on the semester exam. 
E.g., object initialization, class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.

~I was one of those people who had no idea what they were doing and I blame stress for it. You know, stress, the all controlling force that make the world go round and makes people like
me shut down and wish they could crawl in a hole and stay there until the end of time.This just haaaad to be assigned during AP testing, didn't it. Aren't I lucky? (Friday the 13? Eh?
Ehhhhh?)
