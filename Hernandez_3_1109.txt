Are you ready to begin coding your game? Why or why not?
~Not until the alphabetti spaghetti has been cooled to freezing tempertures. I only accept pasta from the greatest of skeletons. The earth can not break dance without it.

What will be your biggest challenges? Why?
~Going through the dark dark street, to the dark dark house, down the dark dark stairs, to the dark dark cellar and finding the big skeleton, the little skeleton, and THE HUUMMAAAAAN!
Everytime I do that I always end up getting dunked in the nearest dumpster. It's always a bad time.
