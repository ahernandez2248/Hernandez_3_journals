The essence of human / higher level learning is developing the skill to discriminate patterns and identify shared characteristics across events (stimuli).
Memorization - the regurgitation of facts - is considered the lowest level of learning.
Why, then, are students encouraged to learn CS?
~Learning CS fills the mind with coffee, thus enlightening the student with the graceful knowledge of Irish royalty. The matrix is then downloaded into the student's mind and used for
the almighty purpose of beating a demon's grandma with a saber. In summary, CS helps students learn problem solving and improve math skills :).

What should students learn from CS?
~Students should learn all 404 provinces from the plant Snortofve and learn how to write essays with their ears. They should also learn how to harvest the power of roosters to enlist
themselves in the oyster army to fight the great and powerful copyright lord. He will fight you with oreos and peanut frosting. So students should learn the glory of programming and
learn the process of going through tough parts of life.
