Are you ready for that test on Friday?
~Sure. I can memorize like a knowledge deprived Terris person when I need to. I will destroy that test, sweep up the remains, and walk out the door with sunglasses before the trashcan 
explodes. Yeeeeeah.

What specific questions do you have about the Slick Game?
~What is the expected due date for the completed game and should we have done by a certain time?

What will you have to do to get this working?
~Learn from the info given to me, forget about it, and use whatever is left to make something work. It works for some reason and sometimes it creates something cool in return. 
Brute force and forgetfulness for the win.

Are you prepared? Do you have all knowledge you need? If not be specific.
~As prepared as an army officer stuck underground with his buddy's shovel collection, a flamethrower, and top notch climbing gear. This game will burn people eyes out. I feel like all the 
things I need are locked in a box, but I have the strength of a thousand titans. I will fight for knowledge if I need to. Literally, someone may or may not get punched.
