For what computational reason did you type elf64?
~Its a 64 bit operating system.
Why did you use ld?

Why did you not have to use chmod to make sample executable?
~The file is already executable
Now - change the code to print your name. You should change the program so that it actually prints your name.
Post the code in your journal

global _start
        section .text
_start:
        ; write(1, message, 13)
        mov     rax, 1                  ; system call 1 is write
        mov     rdi, 1                  ; file handle 1 is stdout
        mov     rsi, message            ; address of string to output
        mov     rdx, 15                 ; number of bytes
        syscall                         ; invoke operating system to do the write

        ; exit(0)
        mov     eax, 60                 ; system call 60 is exit
        xor     rdi, rdi                ; exit code 0
        syscall                         ; invoke operating system to exit
message:

What problem did you have to solve to get it to work?
~Changing the words in parenthesis
Given your actual experience with Assembly now --- Is assembly 'quick and easy'? Why or why not?
~No. Look at all that code just to print a name! That's a lot of work.
What does 'low level' actually mean with regards to programming languages?
~It means more work but it processes faster
